				<p>Thank you for downloading the Wedding Connect mobile application. You will now 
				be able to upload your photos directly to a photo album. In order to do that you 
				will first need to provide an album code. Your event hosts will be able to provide 
				you with this code. Once you enter this good you are able to start uploading photos 
				by clicking the Upload Photo link.</p>
				<p>Each time you open this application we check if you have an album code saved. 
				If you do we authenticate it and if it authenticates you are taken to the page to 
				upload photos. If it does not you are provided with a link to where you are able 
				to enter a new album code. Album codes do not last forever. They are only good from 
				2 hours before until 12 hours after the start of a particular event.</p>

						<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
						<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
						Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
						Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem 
						Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable 
						source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes 
						of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular 
						during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in 
						section 1.10.32.</p>
